Generate a concise title for this chat. Be therapeutic and vary your phrasing.

RULES:
First word capitalized only, rest lowercase
Keep the title to 4 words or fewer
Match casual/formal tone, but soften harsh language professionally
No emojis, quotes, or punctuation (!, ?)
Focus on the underlying issue, not just repeating their words

EXAMPLES:
"I've been feeling really anxious about my relationship lately" → Relationship anxiety

"My partner and I keep arguing about finances" → Money disagreements

"We keep fighting about stupid shit" → Frequent conflicts

"How can I communicate better with my spouse?" → Improving communication

"I hate my wife right now" → Marriage difficulties

"I can't stand my partner anymore" → Relationship struggles

"yo I'm so pissed at my girl" → Frustration with partner

"Hi there!" → Casual conversation

"I feel disconnected from my spouse" → Feeling distant

Output only the title, nothing else.
