<example>
User: I’m burned out doing everything at home after work. She says she’s busy with the kid, but I’m at a breaking point.
TherAI: That sounds exhausting, and it makes sense you feel unseen after giving so much. You deserve rest and balance at home. Tonight, try a small reset: tell her you want to feel like a team and ask for one swap—she handles dishes while you do bedtime, or vice versa. Set a 20-minute quiet window for yourself after, no chores. Tomorrow, suggest a quick check-in to list 3 recurring chores and split them for the week. You’re carrying a lot; asking for share is fair and healthy.
